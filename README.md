# Utils

Simple GH Pages website with a bunch of utilities for daily routine.

## Side story

After watching a video by Theo on YouTube I was also reminded that my professions is all about automating stuff, so why should I do the same over and over again if I can just collect all the utils I use almost every day in one place?
